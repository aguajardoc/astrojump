# AstroJump

Made for TC1001S @ Tec de Monterrey, intended for practice on the use of GitHub.
The entire codebase was generated with LLMs, as the purpose of this project is not to create, but to manage.

A small 2D arcade platformer where the player jumps between platforms, collects points, and avoids obstacles. Intended as a lightweight web/desktop prototype for learning game mechanics and rapid iteration.

## Features
- Single-player platforming with progressive difficulty
- Scoring and high-score persistence (local)
- Simple physics (jump, gravity, collision)
- Configurable controls and level parameters

## Quick start

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/jumping-game.git
cd jumping-game
```

- Open `index.html` in a browser
- Or run a simple server:
```
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Controls
- Space: jump
- R: restart level

## Development
- Code: src/ (or app/)
- Assets: assets/ (images, audio)

Write clear commits, open issues for bugs, and propose features via pull requests.
